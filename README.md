   JARVIS
                                       - A Fun AI Voice Assistant


About the Project

Jarvis is a simple and fun AI voice assistant that can recognize voice commands and perform basic tasks like opening websites, fetching news, and even playing music! It’s not super advanced, but it’s a cool little project to experiment with speech recognition and AI responses.

What Can Jarvis Do?

🎤 Listen to Your Voice: Uses speech recognition to understand what you say.
🌐 Open Websites: Just say, "Open Google" or "Open YouTube," and it will do it for you!
🤖 AI-Powered Chat: Uses OpenAI’s API to generate responses when you ask something.
🎵 Play Music: You can ask it to play songs from a predefined library.
📰 Get the Latest News: It fetches top news headlines using NewsAPI.
🔊 Talk Back to You: Uses text-to-speech (TTS) to respond with a human-like voice.

Technologies Used

Python
speech_recognition (for listening)
pyttsx3 & gTTS (for speaking)
pygame (for playing MP3 files)
webbrowser (for opening websites)
requests (for fetching news)
OpenAI API (for AI responses)
How to Use
Run the script.
Say "Jarvis" to wake it up.
Speak your command, like:
"Open Google" → It opens Google.
"Tell me the news" → It gives you the latest headlines.
"Play [song name]" → It plays the song if it’s in the library.
Jarvis listens, processes, and responds accordingly.


Important Note ⚠️

Due to some glitches, the News API and OpenAI API won’t work by default.
If you want these features to work, please use your own API keys:
OpenAI API Key → For AI-generated responses.
NewsAPI Key → For fetching the latest news.
You can get an OpenAI API key from OpenAI’s website and a NewsAPI key from NewsAPI.
A stable internet connection is required for some features.

Final Thoughts

This project is a great starting point if you want to explore voice recognition, AI, and automation. Feel free to modify it, add new features, and make it even cooler! 🚀
