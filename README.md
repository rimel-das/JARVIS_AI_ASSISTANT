# JARVIS_AI_ASSISTANT
Jarvis is a simple and fun AI voice assistant that can recognize voice commands and perform basic tasks like opening websites, fetching news, and even playing music! It’s not super advanced, but it’s a cool little project to experiment with speech recognition and AI responses.
